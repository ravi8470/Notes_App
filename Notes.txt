The render method works when you have a templating engine, such as Handlebars or Jade, in use. It will only 
diplay the webpage if it is ejs jade ,etc. It won't if its just html.


The sendfile method, on the other hand, simply sends a given file to the client, regardless of the type and
 contents of the file.
